      <td>Hi, My name is Jack. I am currently working on my Google Cybersecurity Certification and going to the
        University of London for Computer Science. I have many years of experience working with the Linux Operating
        System, I have deployed countless servers in my home lab, and written some scripts and programs in Python, JS,
        and Bash. My goal is to work in a digital forensics role someday. I would love to convince you that I have the
        skills and know-how to excel in your workplace!</td>
